# Vulkan_CAD
A small CAD software to show the center of gravity of a mechanical assembly using Qt and Vulkan
Indicate in "voulu2.csv" x y and z positions of the center of gravity , height and weight of each part. 
Global center of gravity will be displayed under the form of a pink pyramid with a white top (the center of gravity)
Plz make sure that voulu2.csv and repere.obj are present in the same folder than the executable (usually the build folder) otherwise it won't work

# Installation
Just install Qt Creator and the Vulkan sdk and you should be able to build and run.
