# Vulkan_CAD
A small CAD software to show the center of gravity of a mechanical assembly using Qt and Vulkan

Indicate in "voulu2.csv" for each part:

- wether the part is a cylinder (p) or a Parallelepiped (p)

- three points (to define a plan) 

- height 

- weight  

Global center of gravity will be displayed under the form of a pink pyramid with a white top (the center of gravity)

Make sure that voulu2.csv and repere.obj are present in the same folder than the executable (usually the build folder) otherwise it won't work
